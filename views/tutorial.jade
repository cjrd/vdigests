        h2 Add a Transcript
        .description
            | On the next pane, you can either upload a text or srt transcript file of the video or use YouTube's autogenerated transcript. Notes: text transcript files must have a ".txt" suffix and srt transcript files must have a ".srt" suffix. Also, YouTube's autogenerated transcripts are typically pretty terrible, so use hand-created transcripts when possible.
